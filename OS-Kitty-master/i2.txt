Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Make it count, play it straight
Don't look back, don't hesitate
When you go big time
What you want, what you feel
Never quit, and make it real
When you roll big time
Hey, hey
Listen to your heart now
Hey, hey
Don't you feel the rush?
Hey, hey
Better take your shot now
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Go and shake it up
What you gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Step it up, get in gear
Go for broke, make it clear
Gotta go big time
Make it work, get it right
Change the world over night
Gotta dream big time (Hey-hey)
Hey, hey
Give it all you've got now
Hey, hey
Isn't it the rush?
Hey, hey
Finish what youâ€¦
